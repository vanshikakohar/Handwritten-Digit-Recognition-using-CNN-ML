Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks
1. Objective
To build a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in image recognition tasks, with applications in:

Automated data entry

Postal mail sorting

Bank check verification

Digitizing historical documents

2. Introduction
Digit recognition has become a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision, serving as a benchmark for testing machine learning models. MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is widely used for this purpose.
The CNN model‚Äôs architecture is designed to automatically extract spatial features and patterns from images, making it a powerful tool for visual pattern recognition tasks like digit classification.

3. Dataset Overview
Attribute	Details
Dataset Name	MNIST
Classes	10 digits (0‚Äì9)
Image Format	Grayscale
Image Dimensions	28 x 28 pixels
Total Pixels per Image	784
Color Depth	8-bit (0‚Äì255 pixel intensity)
Total Images	60,000 (training), 10,000 (testing)

4. CNN Model Architecture
üîç Components
Input Layer: 28√ó28 grayscale images

Convolutional Layers (2 layers): Extract edges, shapes, and patterns using filters

Activation Function (ReLU): Adds non-linearity to capture complex patterns

Pooling Layers (MaxPooling): Downsamples feature maps to reduce computation and prevent overfitting

Flatten Layer: Transforms pooled features into a vector

Fully Connected Layers (Dense): Classify features into digit categories

Output Layer (Softmax): Returns probabilities for each digit (0‚Äì9), with the highest probability as prediction

5. Data Preprocessing
Normalization: Pixel values scaled to [0,1] for faster model convergence

Reshaping: Images reshaped to (28, 28, 1) to fit CNN input

Label Encoding: One-hot encoding applied to digit labels (0‚Äì9)

6. Model Training
Parameter	Value
Optimizer	Adam
Loss Function	Categorical Cross-Entropy
Epochs	100
Batch Size	32
Validation Split	20% of training data
Regularization	Dropout (optional), Early Stopping (optional)

üõ° Overfitting Prevention
Validation Monitoring: Tracks accuracy/loss during training

Early Stopping: Stops training if validation loss increases

Dropout: Randomly disables neurons to improve generalization

7. Results
üìà Model Performance Metrics

üéØ ROC-AUC Curve
Though commonly used for binary classification, multi-class ROC-AUC can be plotted per class or using macro/micro averaging. The ROC-AUC curve demonstrates the model‚Äôs ability to discriminate between classes.
